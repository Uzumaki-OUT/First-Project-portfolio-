This portfolio was created by me for Coursera's Microsoft Front End Developer Course.  The portfolio was the final project and includes a little game of pong. Enjoy! 

At the moment the pong game only works on desktop browsers. The next project will be to make it work on mobile as well. 

I also need to add my email to the contact section to make it usable. Right now it does nothing.
